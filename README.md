# margin-and-padding-1

## Description

This project is designed to practice **CSS margin and padding** by styling div elements to match a given layout. The goal is to adjust spacing using only **margin** and **padding**, without modifying the HTML structure.

## Instructions

2. Only change the margin and padding values where instructed.
3. Do **not** add or remove properties in the CSS.

## Expected Layout

- **Div One** and **Div Three** should have **32px padding** (space between text and border).
- **Div One** should have **12px margin** (space between it and any other element).
- **Div Two** and **Div Three** should have **48px margin** between them.
- **Div Three** should be **aligned to the right**, using **margin** (not flexbox, float, etc.).
